I am bioinformatician, finishing my doctoral degree in comparative
genomics at the bioinformatics research group at the Max Plank
Institute for Evolutionary Biology.

A biologist by training, I am interesting in finding and exploring
biological patterns hidden in genomic data. For this I rely on data
analysis and visualization.
