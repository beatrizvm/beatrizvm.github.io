I am bioinformatician at the [bioinformatics research group]() at the
[Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary
Biology](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/), where I recently finished my
doctoral degree with a thesis on [the detection and annotation of
unique genomic
regions](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:gbv:8:3-2024-01212-2).

A biologist by training, I am interesting in finding and exploring
biological patterns hidden in genomic data. For this I rely on data
analysis and visualization.

Currently, I am wrapping up one of my doctoral projects on the
detection of lineage-specific regions and further developing my
programming skills.
