I am bioinformatician, finishing my doctoral degree in comparative
genomics at the bioinformatics research group at the [Max Plank
Institute for Evolutionary Biology](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/).

A biologist by training, I am interesting in finding and exploring
biological patterns hidden in genomic data. For this I rely on data
analysis and visualization.

Currently, I am exploring the functionality of [globally unique
genomic
regions](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/11/1813/5161082)
in mammalian genomes, and how can we use unique regions to develop a
large scalling pipeline for finding and developing [diagnostic marker
regions](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/15/2081/6124302)
in bacterial pathogens.
